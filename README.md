# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This was created in order to help organize notes on what is learned in the coding bootcamp. It will not only give practice into what the course will cover but also act as a starting point for a development career. By building this website the need to have to search the internet for how to do things that one has already learned, but instead can be found here. This will also be good to look back and reference the journey of the bootcamp to continue to influence a growth mindset. The basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript were learned in order to build this.
